Title and Description: Chefs Talks
The project, Chefs Talks, is designed for creating test recipes and maintaining a consistent menu. It provides a unique interface for waiter and chefs, allowing waiter to access explanations tailored for them, while chefs can view preparation methods created specifically for them. The project emphasizes team collaboration, enabling the entire team to have access to comprehensive information and the complete menu at their fingertips. Additionally, the application allows users to browse through old recipes, sauces, and dressings for inspiration and incorporate them into new ideas.

Installation: The installation process follows the standard Angular installation steps.

Running the Application: To start the application, use the command ng serve. The application is also hosted on Andon-ov.github.io, but in-depth exploration is restricted to registered users.

Project Structure:  It includes modules for users, forms, core functionalities (containing footer and header components), and a shared module that houses most services. The key components include menus (including a test menu), administrative features for creating and editing recipes, and user capabilities for commenting and reading.
